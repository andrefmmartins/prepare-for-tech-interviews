Technical and HR interviews ‚Äì if you want to be successful in a recruitment process, you‚Äôll need to go through both. Let's break down the typical stages of a tech hiring process.

### Screening Call

Many companies initiate the recruitment process with a brief 15- to 30-minute introductory call. This crucial step allows both parties to assess mutual fit and ensure alignment, effectively preventing wasted time for everyone involved. Prioritize companies that employ this positive practice in recruitment over those that immediately proceed to technical challenges or interviews.

***Do you know the company:*** Even if a recruiter contacts you directly (so you didn't apply for the job), always ensure you research the company's core business and target markets. This fundamental knowledge, though seemingly simple, can significantly influence your first impression. Remember, first impressions count.

***Who are you:*** Be ready to articulate your professional background concisely. I typically ask candidates to describe their current role (key responsibilities, tech stack, team structure) and their future career aspirations. Keep it brief; this is a screening call, not a deep dive.

***Language proficiency:*** For roles within multinational companies where English is the primary language of communication, be prepared to conduct the  conversation in English.

***HR Topics:*** Prepare to discuss your notice period (in some cases, you might be asked if it‚Äôs negotiable or not, and be honest about it, if you don‚Äôt know, just say it, don‚Äôt overpromise something you are not capable of). You‚Äôll (or you should) approach salary & benefits expected.
  *The sooner the better:* Keep in mind that budgets are frequently flexible, varying based on the specific skills and value you can bring to the role and team. Aim to ascertain the potential flexibility or percentage by which the stated budget can shift. While a job posting might not include a salary range, don't dismiss an opportunity outright. Instead, get the compensation conversation out of the way as soon as possible to ensure alignment for both parties.
  *Compare with the market, not with your peers:* It is advisable to understand the business context and frame your compensation expectations based on demonstrable value and market data.
  *Salary vs. Money:* Contract, perks, equity, bonus, taxes‚Ä¶
  *Highest Salary vs. Best Job:* Remember, you have a career strategy, don‚Äôt you? ;)

### Technical Interview
  
Show time!

***Engineering over syntax:*** If feasible, consider writing your code in a language different from the company's primary one. This encourages interviewers to focus on your implementation and problem-solving skills, rather than specific language 'tricks' or syntax nuances.

***Words over bits:*** Don't just deliver code; always provide a clear explanation of your decisions and implementation choices. This crucial step is often overlooked, but interviewers want to understand the "how" and "why" behind your solution, not just the outcome.

***Data over assumptions:*** Always ask for clarification on expectations. Don't hesitate to inquire what they're looking for: "code written in stone," quick fixes, branching, a runnable example‚Äîwhatever it may be. Just ask.

**Which type of questions to expect?**

While specific questions will naturally vary across companies and even among different engineering teams within the same organization, some common themes and examples you might encounter include:

3. Debugging and performance optimization: Examine candidates‚Äô skills in identifying and resolving issues, as well as optimizing code for better performance.

Debugging:
-	Understand Your Tools: Every language/IDE has a debugger (e.g., Chrome DevTools, GDB, Visual Studio Debugger). Learn to set breakpoints, step through code, inspect variables, and view call stacks.
-	Logging: Use print or logging statements strategically to trace execution flow and variable values.
-	Reproduce the Bug: The first step is always to reliably reproduce the error.
-	Isolate the Problem: Use binary search or divide-and-conquer to narrow down the faulty code section.
-	Rubber Duck Debugging: Explain your code aloud to an inanimate object (or a person) ‚Äì often helps identify the flaw.
-	Version Control: Use Git to revert to previous working states.

Performance Optimization:
-	Measure First (Profiling): Don't guess! Use profiling tools (e.g., perf, cProfile, browser performance tabs, Xcode Instruments) to identify actual bottlenecks (CPU, memory, I/O).
-	Do Less Work:
  -	Better Algorithms/Data Structures: Choose more efficient ones for your problem (e.g., a hash map vs. linear scan for lookups).
  -	Avoid Redundant Work: Cache results, move computations outside loops, use lazy evaluation.
  -	Optimize Data Access: Reduce network requests, optimize database queries, minimize DOM manipulations.
-	Understand System Characteristics: Is your app CPU-bound, memory-bound, or I/O-bound? Optimize the right bottleneck.
-	Asynchronous Operations/Parallelism: For long-running tasks, use asynchronous code or multithreading/multiprocessing (if applicable to your language/platform) to avoid blocking the main thread.
-	Memory Management: Address memory leaks and optimize memory usage (e.g., reduce object creation).
-	Trade-offs: Optimization often involves trade-offs (e.g., speed vs. memory, development time vs. runtime performance). Know when "good enough" is sufficient.

Key takeaway: Debugging is about finding why it's broken; optimization is about making it faster/more efficient. Both require understanding your tools, analytical thinking, and a systematic approach.

4. Code readability and maintainability: Analyze candidates‚Äô approach to writing clean, readable, and maintainable code.

Consistent Formatting:
-	Follow Style Guides: Adhere to established style guides for your language (e.g., PEP 8 for Python, Google Java Style Guide).
-	Linters/Formatters: Use tools like Prettier, Black, ESLint, or your IDE's built-in formatter to automate consistency.
-	Consistent Indentation, Spacing, Bracing: Small details matter.
  
Meaningful Naming:
-	Variables, Functions, Classes: Use descriptive, clear names that indicate purpose or content (e.g., calculateTotalPrice instead of calc, userList instead of ul).
-	Avoid Abbreviations: Unless universally understood within your domain.
-	Be Consistent: If you use getUsers, don't then use Workspace_items.

Clear Structure & Organization:
-	Modularize: Break down large functions/classes into smaller, single-responsibility units.
-	Logical Grouping: Keep related code together.
-	Consistent File Structure: Organize files and directories predictably.

Effective Comments & Documentation:
-	Why, Not What: Explain why certain decisions were made, complex logic, or potential pitfalls, rather than just restating obvious code.
-	Docstrings/XML Comments: Use them for functions, classes, and modules to explain their purpose, arguments, and return values.
-	Keep them Updated: Outdated comments are worse than no comments.

Simplicity & Clarity:
-	KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid): Write the simplest code that solves the problem.
-	Avoid Over-Engineering: Don't build complex solutions for simple problems.
-	Limit Nesting: Reduce deeply nested if/else or loops.
-	Early Exit: Use guard clauses to handle error cases or edge conditions early, reducing indentation.
-	Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Each function/class should do one thing and do it well.

Avoid Duplication (DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself):
-	Refactor repeated code into functions or classes. Duplication makes changes harder and introduces potential for errors.

Error Handling:
-	Graceful Errors: Handle errors explicitly and informatively.
-	Clear Error Messages: Make it easy to understand what went wrong.

Be aware that some companies conduct live coding sessions during the technical interview. Key concepts you should be familiar with include:

- Live coding exercises: Observe candidates‚Äô‚Äô coding skills in real-time, including their problem-solving approach and coding style.
-	Pair programming: Evaluate candidates‚Äô ability to work collaboratively, communicate effectively, and solve problems as a team.
-	Code reviews: Assess candidates' ability to write well-structured, efficient, and secure code through a peer review process.
-	Technical challenges: Test candidates‚Äô ability to apply their knowledge to solve complex technical challenges.

### HR Interview

This step of the process is to understand two main components:

1.	Soft-skills

Which soft-skills? The specific soft skills assessed depend directly on whether you are applying for an individual contributor role or a leadership position (e.g., Manager, Director, VP). Consequently, the interview's focus and depth will evolve substantially with the seniority of the role.

Regardless of the role's seniority, effective communication skills are paramount‚Äîwithout them, other competencies lose their impact. This stage often emphasizes your ability to communicate clearly, your resilience in difficult or frustrating situations (under pressure), and your openness to feedback.

2.	‚ÄòCultural fit‚Äô

The concept of 'cultural fit' is frequently misunderstood by both companies and candidates. It should fundamentally mean bringing together diverse individuals who align with the organization's core principles and values. Therefore, ensure you are familiar with the company's stated values‚Äîthese are typically published on their website‚Äîto assess your alignment.

__Which type of questions to expect?__

_Please be aware that the questions listed below serve as illustrative examples of what may be asked during this step of the hiring process._

-	Why do you think our company would be the next great step in your career?
-	Tell me about a professional frustration.
-	Tell me about the biggest challenge you had to face in your career so far.
-	What do you expect from your manager? Which soft skills do you value in a manager?
-	How do you react to feedback?

In short, behavioural interview questions try to understand:

-	Handling workplace challenges: Explore how candidates navigate difficult situations and demonstrate problem-solving skills.
-	Effective teamwork and collaboration: Discuss experiences in working within a team, showcasing communication and conflict resolution abilities.
-	Adaptability and learning: Analyze how candidates have adapted to new challenges and what they have learned from these experiences.
-	Leadership qualities: Examine instances where candidates have demonstrated leadership skills and the impact of their actions.

## Overall ‚Äì HR & Tech

***This is not only about qualifications, not at all:*** The main goal is to check if your values and motivations are aligned with the company you‚Äôre interviewing to.
***Don‚Äôt prepare an interview. Prepare yourself to be interviewed:*** Instead of preparing questions in advance, memorizing ‚Äúproper‚Äù answers, work on your verbal and body communication to expose your thoughts with the highest accuracy possible.
***2-way Evaluation:*** Don‚Äôt forget you are evaluating too.

Don't overlook the opportunity to ask questions to your interviewers. Many candidates miss this crucial step. Throughout the hiring process, actively build documentation, gather insights, and strive to understand if the company, role, and culture truly align with your aspirations.
